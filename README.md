# Random Store

'Random Store' is an e-commerce store which features products from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/).

Built with React, this project utilises packages such as [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for global state management and [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) for navigating between the views of various components.

Users can add and remove products from their shopping cart and track the total cost of their order.

IMPORTANT: This project does not have a checkout page (the checkout button within the shopping cart is for aesthetic purposes only).
